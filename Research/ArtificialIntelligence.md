# Artificial Intelligence Notes

## What is artificial intelligence?
Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines. It has become an essential part of the technology industry. 

Research associated with artificial intelligence is highly technical and specialized. The core problems of artificial intelligence include programming computers for certain traits such as: 
* Knowledge
* Reasoning
* Problem solving
* Perception
* Learning
* Planning
* Ability to manipulate and move objects

Artificial intelligence is a term for simulated intelligence in machines. These machines are programmed to “think” like a human and mimic the way a person act. Artificial intelligence is based around the idea that human intelligence can be defined in such exact terms that a machine can mimic it. 


## How does it work?
AI works by combining large amounts of data with fast, iterative processing and intelligent algorithms, allowing the software to learn automatically from patterns or features in the data. AI is a broad field of study that includes many theories, methods and technologies, as well as the following major subfields: 

* **Machine Learning** automates analytical model building. It uses methods from neural networks, statistics, operations research and physics to find hidden insights in data without explicitly being programmed for where to look or what to conclude.

* **A Neural Network** is a type of machine learning that is made up of interconnected units (like neurons) that processes information by responding to external inputs, relaying information between each unit. The process requires multiple passes at the data to find connections and derive meaning from undefined data.

* **Deep Learning** uses huge neural networks with many layers of processing units, taking advantage of advances in computing power and improved training techniques to learn complex patterns in large amounts of data. Common applications include image and speech recognition.

* **Cognitive computing** is a subfield of AI that strives for a natural, human-like interaction with machines. Using AI and cognitive computing, the ultimate goal is for a machine to simulate human processes through the ability to interpret images and speech – and then speak coherently in response.  

* **Computer vision** relies on pattern recognition and deep learning to recognize what’s in a picture or video. When machines can process, analyze and understand images, they can capture images or videos in real time and interpret their surroundings.

* **Natural language processing** (NLP) is the ability of computers to analyze, understand and generate human language, including speech. The next stage of NLP is natural language interaction, which allows humans to communicate with computers using normal, everyday language to perform tasks.

## Difference between Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning & Deep Learning
AI involves machines that can perform tasks that are characteristic of human intelligence. 
Machine learning is simply a way of achieving AI.
Deep learning is one of many approaches to machine learning. 


AI is human intelligence exhibited by machines
Machine Learning is an approach to achieving artificial intelligence
Deep Learning is a technique for implementing machine learning

## Examples of artificial intelligence
**Grading and Assessment**
Plagiarism Checkers: plagiarism detection for regular text (essays, books, etc.) relies on a having a massive database of reference materials to compare to the student text; however, ML can help detect the plagiarizing of sources that are not located within the database, such as sources in foreign languages or older sources that have not been digitized.


**Social Networking**
Facebook: When you upload photos to Facebook, the service automatically highlights faces and suggests friends to tag. Facebook uses AI to recognize faces. 


**Mobile Use**
Voice-to-text: A standard feature on smartphones today is voice-to-text. By pressing a button or saying a particular phrase (“Ok Google”, for example), you can start speaking and your phone converts the audio into text. Nowadays, this is a relatively routine task, but for many years, accurate automated transcription was beyond the abilities of even the most advanced computers. Google uses artificial neural networks to power voice search.


**Work & School**
Ridesharing app UBER: Uber’s Head of Machine Learning Danny Lange confirmed Uber’s use of machine learning for ETAs for rides, estimated meal delivery times on UberEATS, computing optimal pickup locations, as well as for fraud detection.
