# Project Leamoji

This is the repository for my project called Leamoji. 
The purpose of this project is to protect and make children more aware of what to come in a movie or show that theyâ€™re watching. 
How I want to this is to develop a model that analyzes a video on the emotions shown in the scenes. And based on the emotion show an emoji in the video player.
